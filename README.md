**node server.js**

 **npm i**

The end-user will then enter the name of the burger they wish to log by entering the name of the burger in the 'add burgers' prompt  and clicking the 'update burger(s)' button (pictured on the right here). The Burger will proceed to  move to the 'Available burgers' section.

![](/public/assets/img/devourBurger.png)

The end-user will now click the 'devour Burger' button so that the Burger is consumed  and  moves to the 'devoured burgers' section. 

![](/public/assets/img/deleteBurger.png)

The end-user is presented here  with the screen  where they will be able to delete the burger from the 'devoured burger' section by clicking the 'delete burger' button.
